# Tasks: UI Desktop Integration (Tauri)

Feature Dir: `/home/ekwator/Code/truth-training/specs/002-ui-desktop-integration`
Branch: `002-ui-desktop-integration`

Conventions:
- [P] = can run in parallel with other [P] tasks (different files/areas)
- Use absolute paths; create files if missing
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implement

## Parallel Execution Guidance
- Group 1 [P]: T003,T004
- Group 2 [P]: T101..T108 (independent contract tests)
- Group 3 [P]: T202,T203,T204,T205,T208,T209,T210
- Group 4 [P]: T401,T402,T403,T404

## Notes
- UI must prioritize basic metrics only (consensus, participant count)
- Anonymous access only; no account screens
- Dual connectivity (HTTP API + optional FFI via Tauri commands)
- Enforce <200ms response UX target in performance tests
