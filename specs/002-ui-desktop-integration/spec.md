# Feature Specification: UI Desktop Integration (Tauri)

**Feature Branch**: `002-ui-desktop-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# UI Desktop Integration (Tauri)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üß† Align with collective intelligence principles and truth training methodology

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-18
- Q: What authentication model should the UI support for user participation? ‚Üí A: Anonymous access only - users participate without accounts
- Q: How should the UI connect to the core system? ‚Üí A: Both HTTP API and FFI - UI can use either method
- Q: What should be the maximum response time for UI operations? ‚Üí A: under 200ms
- Q: Which error conditions should the UI handle gracefully? ‚Üí A: All error types - comprehensive error handling for all scenarios
- Q: Which data visualization metrics should the UI prioritize? ‚Üí A: Basic metrics only - consensus values, participant counts

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A desktop user needs a graphical interface to interact with the Truth Collective Intelligence System, allowing them to create events, visualize collective progress, monitor synchronization status, and participate in the distributed truth verification process without requiring command-line expertise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user launches the desktop application, **When** they open the main interface, **Then** they see a dashboard showing recent events, sync status, and available actions
2. **Given** a user wants to create a new event, **When** they click "Create Event" and fill in the details, **Then** the event is submitted to the collective intelligence system and appears in their local view
3. **Given** a user wants to participate in collective judgment, **When** they view an event requiring evaluation, **Then** they can submit their judgment with confidence level and reasoning
4. **Given** a user is offline, **When** they interact with the application, **Then** their actions are queued locally and synchronized when connectivity is restored
5. **Given** a user wants to see collective progress, **When** they navigate to the progress view, **Then** they see visualizations of consensus evolution, reputation trends, and collective intelligence metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the core API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle network connectivity loss during synchronization?
- What occurs when multiple users try to create conflicting events simultaneously?
- How does the interface handle large datasets or slow consensus calculations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical users
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create and submit events to the collective intelligence system
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable users to participate in collective judgment processes with confidence levels and reasoning
- **FR-004**: System MUST display real-time synchronization status and network connectivity information
- **FR-005**: System MUST visualize collective progress through basic metrics - consensus values, participant counts, and simple trend indicators
- **FR-006**: System MUST operate in offline-first mode, queuing actions locally when disconnected
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically synchronize with the collective intelligence system when connectivity is restored
- **FR-008**: System MUST follow UX guidelines from spec/09-ux-guidelines.md for consistent user experience
- **FR-009**: System MUST connect to the core system via both HTTP API and FFI - UI can use either method depending on operation type
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle all error types comprehensively - network errors, core system errors, user input errors, and data corruption scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST support anonymous access only - users participate without requiring accounts or authentication

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST respond to user interactions within 200ms for optimal responsiveness
- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle offline operations gracefully with clear status indicators
- **NFR-003**: System MUST maintain data consistency during network interruptions
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide clear error messages and recovery options for all failure scenarios
- **NFR-005**: System MUST gracefully degrade functionality when core system components are unavailable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents a truth claim or statement submitted to the collective intelligence system, containing description, context, timestamps, and current consensus status
- **Judgment**: Represents a user's evaluation of an event, including assessment (true/false), confidence level, reasoning, and submission timestamp
- **Consensus**: Represents the collective intelligence result for an event, including consensus value, confidence score, participant count, and calculation timestamp
- **Sync Status**: Represents the current state of synchronization with the collective intelligence network, including connectivity status, pending operations, and last sync time
