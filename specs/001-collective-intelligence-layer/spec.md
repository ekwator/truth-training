# Feature Specification: Collective Intelligence Layer (Wisdom of the Crowd)

**Feature Branch**: `001-collective-intelligence-layer`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Collective Intelligence Layer (Wisdom of the Crowd)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üß† Align with collective intelligence principles and truth training methodology

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-20
- Q: What is the minimum number of participants required for valid consensus calculation? ‚Üí A: unlimited participation (no minimum)
- Q: What level of visibility should participants have into individual judgments and reputation scores? ‚Üí A: Fully anonymous judgments; only aggregate consensus visible

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A participant in the Truth Training platform wants to contribute their judgment about an event and see how their input influences the collective consensus. They expect their reputation to be updated based on the accuracy of their past judgments, and they want to observe how the wisdom of the crowd converges toward truth over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a participant has joined the network, **When** they submit their judgment about an event, **Then** their input is weighted according to their reputation and contributes to the collective consensus
2. **Given** multiple participants have submitted judgments, **When** the system processes all inputs, **Then** it calculates a weighted consensus that reflects the collective intelligence
3. **Given** a participant's judgment proves accurate over time, **When** their reputation is updated, **Then** their future judgments carry more weight in the collective decision-making process
4. **Given** the collective has reached a consensus, **When** new information emerges, **Then** the system can adapt and converge toward a new truth through continued collective input

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a participant with high reputation submits an outlier judgment?
- How does the system handle participants who consistently submit inaccurate judgments?
- What occurs when there is insufficient participation for meaningful consensus?
- How does the system handle conflicting information from equally reputable sources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow participants to submit judgments about events with their confidence levels
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate weighted consensus based on participant reputation and judgment accuracy
- **FR-003**: System MUST update participant reputation based on the accuracy of their past judgments
- **FR-004**: System MUST display collective consensus evolution over time to participants
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter out extreme outliers while preserving valuable minority perspectives
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain historical records of all judgments and consensus changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST calculate consensus with any number of participants (N ‚â• 1); when N = 1, consensus equals the single judgment
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce full anonymity for individual judgments; only aggregate consensus and anonymized summary statistics are visible

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Participant**: Individual contributor with reputation score, judgment history, and influence weight
- **Event**: Observable occurrence that can be evaluated by multiple participants
- **Judgment**: Participant's assessment of an event with confidence level and timestamp
- **Consensus**: Weighted collective decision emerging from multiple judgments
- **Reputation**: Dynamic score reflecting participant's historical accuracy and influence
- **Collective Intelligence**: Emergent property arising from the interaction of multiple participants
