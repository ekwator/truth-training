P2P Module Functionality Analysis
The p2p module implements peer-to-peer functionality for the "Truth Training" application:

P2P Module Components:
encryption.rs - Cryptographic Identity:
CryptoIdentity - structure for managing Ed25519 keys
new() - generate new key pair
sign() - sign data
verify() - verify signature
public_key_hex() - get public key in hex

node.rs - P2P Node:
Node - node structure with peer list, DB and crypto-identity
start() - start periodic synchronization with peers (every 30 sec)

sync.rs - Peer Synchronization:
sync_with_peer() - asynchronous synchronization with specific peer
Signs requests and verifies responses

net.rs - Network Discovery:
UDP beacons for discovering other nodes in local network
run_beacon_sender() - send beacons every 7 sec
run_beacon_listener() - listen for beacons from other nodes

Server API Commands List
Here's the complete list of implemented server API endpoints:

1. GET /health
Description: Server health check
Response: 200 OK with body "OK"
Usage: Server availability monitoring

2. GET /statements
Description: Get list of all statements (stub)
Response: 200 OK with JSON array of strings (currently empty)
Status: TODO - requires implementation in core_lib

3. POST /statements
Description: Add new statement (stub)
Request body:
Response: 200 OK with JSON string "TODO"
Status: TODO - requires implementation in core_lib

4. GET /events
Description: Get list of all truth events with cryptographic authentication
Headers:
X-Public-Key: hex-encoded Ed25519 public key
X-Signature: hex-encoded message signature
Authentication: Verifies message signature sync_request:{timestamp}
Response:
200 OK with JSON array of events on successful authentication
401 Unauthorized on invalid signature
Usage: P2P synchronization between nodes

5. POST /events
Description: Add new truth event
Request body:
Response: 200 OK with JSON object {"id": "event_id"}
Automatically sets: code: 1, timestamp_start: current time

6. POST /impacts
Description: Add new impact to event
Request body: JSON Impact object:
Response: 200 OK with JSON object {"id": "impact_id"}

Implementation Features:
Asynchronicity: All endpoints use actix-web with asynchronous handlers
Database: Uses web::block for blocking SQLite operations
P2P Security: /events endpoint requires cryptographic authentication
Error Handling: Detailed error messages for debugging
Typing: Strict typing with serde for serialization/deserialization

Summary
✅ Fixed SigningKey::generate error - p2p/encryption.rs module now compiles correctly
✅ Verified P2P module functionality - module includes:
Cryptographic identity (Ed25519)
P2P node with periodic synchronization
Network discovery via UDP beacons
Secure synchronization between peers
✅ Created complete server API commands list - 6 endpoints:
GET /health - health check
GET /statements - get statements (stub)
POST /statements - add statements (stub)
GET /events - get events with P2P authentication
POST /events - add truth events
POST /impacts - add impacts

The P2P module is fully functional and integrated into the main application to provide decentralized data synchronization between nodes.
