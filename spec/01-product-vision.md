Truth Training fosters a resilient, decentralized information space where collective intelligence evaluates events, combats fraud, and tracks progress over time.

- Problem: fraud exploits trust; isolated actors can harm collective development.
- Solution: P2P app that records events, evaluates claims with expert heuristics and community signals, and synchronizes knowledge.
- Outcomes:
  - Individual: clarity, progress metrics, better decisions.
  - Group: shared context, reduced misinformation impact, convergence on truth.

Stakeholders: end users, validators, app developers, UI teams.

Success metrics: adoption, sync reliability, evaluation consistency, time to verify, reduced conflicting states.
