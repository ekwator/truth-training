## Open Questions & Risks

- What validator identity format to store in impact.user_id (pubkey hex vs alias)?
- Event_score persistence location (truth_events.event_score vs separate table)?
- Thresholds defaults (T_up, T_down, T_confirm) and tuning process.
- Anti-Sybil measures scope for first release.
- Permission model for /get_data in production (auth?).
